# OPEN
000: Can optimize with stride and offset
002: Computing proper prime table takes ~30 minutes, should compute table once
    then load it from binary data.

# CLOSED
001: 999993 and 999995 compute incorrect factorization
    Prime factor table was too small, correct primes were not present in table
