000: Can optimize with stride and offset
002: Computing proper prime table takes ~30 minutes, should compute table once
    then load it from binary data. Another idea, perhaps for a different project,
    is to explore better prime number generating algorithms like the one found here:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

# CLOSED
001: 999993 and 999995 compute incorrect factorization
    Prime factor table was too small, correct primes were not present in table
